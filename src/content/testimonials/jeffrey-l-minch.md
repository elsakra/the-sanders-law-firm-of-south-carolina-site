quote: "As the CEO of a public company engaged in a highly regulated business, I had the great pleasure of working with Zoe Sanders in defending my company against an attempt by the State of South Carolina to, essentially, destroy our business in South Carolina. The stakes were very high -- literally the survival of the business. Zoe won a complete and total victory of the kind where you hear the lamentations of your enemy as you count coups at your victorious campfire. After threatening us with extinction and on the verge of trial, she made the State of South Carolina Department of Revenue back down, terminate the cause of action, settle on a basis completely favorable to us. She won such a convincing victory as to be beyond belief. Not just in making the SC DOR back down on the verge of trial but on many interim rulings in which her knowledge of the courts, the laws, the Judges put us -- from Texas -- on an equal footing as the home team. She is smart as Hell, clever, a brilliant strategic and tactical thinker, well-connected, experienced, and a legal force to be reckoned with. She is an unabashed advocate for your interest, a legal assassin. If I were to undertake any legal matter in the State of South Carolina, she would be the first person I would call. She is personable, articulate, thoughtful, honest, persuasive, and makes the client-attorney relationship fun and pleasant. She wins which is the important thing, is it not?"
